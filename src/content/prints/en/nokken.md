By the water’s edge rests a stillness that is not entirely empty. 
Something is present, even when barely seen.

In this interpretation of Nøkken, the moment is set at the boundary between surface and depth, 
between what is visible and what is only sensed. 
The figure emerges from water and shadow — 
not as a threat, but as a sign that something beneath the surface calls for attention. 
The water holds both attraction and gravity.

Nøkken appears not merely as a luring presence, 
but as an image of what cannot be fully controlled. 
In the encounter with depth lies both unease and insight — 
not through force, but through stillness.
