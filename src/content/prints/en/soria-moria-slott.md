Far in the distance, the castle emerges, bathed in light. 
A destination that seems unreachable, yet still draws us forward.

In this interpretation of Soria Moria, the moment is set before arrival — 
before triumph, before resolution. The journey remains underway, 
and the landscape holds both resistance and hope. The castle stands as a promise, 
not a certainty.

The motif concerns not arrival, but direction. 
The light that persists even when the path is unclear, 
and the longing that leads us toward what we do not yet see.
