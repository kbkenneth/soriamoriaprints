Deep within the forest rests a stillness that is not empty. 
Between trunks and shadows, a presence can be sensed — as if it belongs to the place itself.

In this interpretation of Skogstroll, the moment is set in the quiet encounter 
between human and landscape, between the familiar and the ancient. 
The figure emerges from the darkness of the woods, not as an enemy, 
but as part of the terrain — shaped by earth, roots and time.

The forest troll appears not as a monster, 
but as an image of nature’s own persistence. 
Within the dense and shadowed lies a weight that can both unsettle and ground — 
a reminder that we, too, belong to what grows and endures.
