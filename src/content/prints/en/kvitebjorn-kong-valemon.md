To encounter the unfamiliar is also to encounter what is hidden within ourselves.

In this interpretation of Kvitebjørn kong Valemon, the moment is placed in the stillness before transformation. 
The figure carries strength and vulnerability, the animal and the human. 
The motif holds trial, but also promise.

The White Bear does not appear as a monster, 
but as a presence bearing more than the eye can see. 
In the tension between darkness and light lies the possibility of transformation — 
not through force, but through trust.
