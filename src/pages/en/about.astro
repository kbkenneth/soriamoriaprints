            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>
                SoriaMoriaPrints began with a quiet fascination for the stillness and gravity of Nordic fairy tales. 
                Within these stories lie both darkness and light, trial and promise — motifs that still resonate in our own time.
            </p><p>
                The project does not seek to retell the tales as they were once told, 
                but to return to the moments before transformation, before arrival — before the hidden is revealed. 
                It is in this interval, between shadow and light, between loss and hope, that the images take form.
            </p><p>
                Here, longing and direction are explored — along with the quiet trust that follows. 
                Not as explanation, but as experience. 
                The works invite reflection, allowing the stories to be encountered again, in stillness.
            </p><p>
                SoriaMoriaPrints offers these old tales a renewed space — 
                not as nostalgia, but as living images of what continues to shape and move us.
